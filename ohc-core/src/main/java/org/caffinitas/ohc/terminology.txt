Shard :
    The whole cache is split into multiple shards.
    Each shard consists of one OffHeapMap instance.
    All accesses to critical sections of a shard are guarded by an exclusive lock.

Segment :
    OffHeapMap basically consists of a table and a lock.
    Each entry in that table references the whole segment indirectly via a double-linked-list rooted in one
    bucket.

Bucket :
    Element in the hash table of OffHeapMap. Currently just contains a pointer to the first element.

Entry :
    Key + value + some metadata. A bucket points to one entry. Each entry has references to its two
    neighbors ("next" + "previous").
